## Solving Impossible Puzzles

### Degrees of Freedom;

### Don’t Think Outside the Box—Find the Box

### Get Out of Your Own Way!

one trick

集中想问题往往不如，You’ll be amazed how often the answer will just pop into your head when you deliberately distract yourself.

To put it plainly—people who were distracted did better on a complex problem-solving task than people who put in conscious effort.

通过切换分心的行为(作者在玩一个困难的游戏，切换玩一个简单的)，会实际有更好的效果

second trick

tell other people your problem:
* Why are you solving this problem?
* What’s the benefit of solving it?
* Are the problems you’re having related to edge cases? Can you eliminate them?
* Is there a simpler, related problem you can solve?

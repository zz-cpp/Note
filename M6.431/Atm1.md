### Function

Sometimes, the notation “the function  $f(\cdot )$" is employed, instead of the notation “the function $f$." This can be useful, because in a statement such as “suppose that $f$ is positive," it is not clear whether  $f$ is a number or a function. The alternative statement “suppose that $f(\cdot)$ is positive" makes it clear that we are talking about a positive function, and serves as a convenient shorthand for the statement “suppose that $f(x)$ is positive for all $x$."
